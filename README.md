# To-Do List React Project â€“ 4Geeks API Version

A sleek, dark-themed to-do list app built with React.  
This branch connects the frontend to the official 4Geeks Academy REST API using `fetch()` calls for full CRUD functionality.

This version was created to meet the official assignment specifications exactly, using the provided backend routes and methods.

## Learning Goals (Met)

- `useState` and `useEffect` for side-effect-based API sync
- `map()` and conditional rendering
- RESTful API integration with async/await and fetch
- Error handling and optimistic UI updates
- Fallback handling for deleted users
- Git branching and project cleanup
- Following and delivering to real-world API specs

## API Integration Details

This project interacts with the official 4Geeks API:

- `GET https://playground.4geeks.com/todo/users/richard_h_todo`
- `POST https://playground.4geeks.com/todo/todos/richard_h_todo`
- `DELETE https://playground.4geeks.com/todo/todos/:id`

All calls are unauthenticated and use the `richard_h_todo` namespace.  
If the user is not found, the app will automatically create the user via `POST` and retry loading tasks.
